/**
 A layout that arranges views in a row, adding rows when needed.
 
 Each row height will be determined by the tallest element. The overall frame size will fit to the size of the laid out content.
 
 Example:
 ```swift
     HFlowLayout {
        ForEach(["Hello", "World", "More Text"], id: \.self) { item in
            Text(item.value)
        }
     }
 ```

    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - alignment: Used to align views vertically in their rows and align rows horizontally relative to each other. Default is top leading. Vertical justification will act as top alignment.
    ///   - horizontalSpacing: Minimum horizontal spacing between views in a row.
    ///   - verticalSpacing: Vertical spacing between rows.
